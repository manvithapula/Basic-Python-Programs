# Python-Programs
WEEK 10- 

101. Write a python program to calculate the sum of Two numbers and Three numbers.
However, if the sum is between 120 to 320 it will return 200.

102. Implement a python function to find the Maximum of Three numbers.

103. Write a python program to calculate the Factorial of a given number.

104. Write a python program to Check if a Number is Even or Odd and also check whether
it is Prime or not.

105. Implement a python function to Reverse a given String and also check for palindrome
or not.

106. Write a python program to Generate Fibonacci Sequence.

107. Write a python program to calculate the area and perimeter of different geometric
shapes (circle, rectangle, triangle, etc.).

108. Implement a python function to Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and Fahrenheit to
Celsius.

109. Write a Python program that accepts a string and counts the number of upper and
lower case letters.

1010. Write a python program to perform Arithmetic operations on Complex Numbers.

WEEK 11- 

111. Implement a python program to find the first largest and second largest numbers in an
Array. Note: should not use any built-in sorting functions or libraries.

112. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of even numbers and the sum of odd
numbers in an array.

113. Write a python program to count the Occurrences of a Specific Element in an Array.

114. Write a Python program that takes a sentence as input and identifies and prints all the palindromic words in the sentence. Use an array to store the palindromic words.

115. Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers and removes all duplicates from the list, preserving the original order of elements.

116. Write a Python program that performs matrix multiplication. Ask the user to input twomatrices as lists of lists (2D arrays) and then multiply them if possible. Make sure to check if the matrices are compatible for multiplication and handle errors gracefully.

117. Write a python program to print diamond number pattern using Nested Loops.


118. Write a Python program that simulates a simple guessing game. Generate a random
number and have the user guess it. Provide hints like too high& or too low until they
guess correctly.

119. Write a Python program that checks the strength of a password entered by a user. The program should assess the password based on criteria like length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Use control structures and arrays to provide a detailed evaluation.

1110. Write a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using a loop and stores it in an array.
